    "In this section, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python. Through hands-on examples and exercises, you will gain a solid understanding of how variables are assigned and manipulated in Python. Additionally, we will cover mathematical operators, which are essential for performing arithmetic operations on numeric variables. Below is a table overview:\n",

    "Declaring variables is a fundamental concept in programming that involves assigning a name to a value or data. In Python, declaring variables is straightforward and doesn't require explicit type declaration. You simply choose a name for the variable and use the assignment operator `(=)` to assign a value to it. Python dynamically infers the data type based on the assigned value. By declaring variables, you can store and manipulate data, making your code more flexible and powerful."
