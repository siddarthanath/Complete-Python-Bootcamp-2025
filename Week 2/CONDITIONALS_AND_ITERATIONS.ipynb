    "In this section, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Python. You will learn how to declare variables, assign values, and explore different data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans. Through hands-on examples and exercises, you will gain a solid understanding of how variables store and manipulate data in Python. Additionally, we will cover mathematical operators, which are essential for performing arithmetic operations on numeric variables. Below is a table overview:\n",
